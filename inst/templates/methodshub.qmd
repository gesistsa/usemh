## Science Usecase(s)

<!-- - Include usecases from social sciences that would make this method applicable in a certain scenario.  -->
<!-- The use cases or research questions mentioned should arise from the latest social science literature cited in the description. -->

This package was used in the literature to valid topic models and prediction models trained on text data, e.g. [Rauchfleisch et al. (2023)](10.1080/17512786.2022.2110928), [Rothut, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448231164409), [Eisele, et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19312458.2023.2230560).

## Repository structure

This repository follows [the standard structure of an R package](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Package-structure).

## Environment Setup

With R installed:

```r
install.packages("{{Package}}")
```

<!-- ## Hardware Requirements (Optional) -->
<!-- - The hardware requirements may be needed in specific cases when a method is known to require more memory/compute power.  -->
<!-- - The method need to be executed on a specific architecture (GPUs, Hadoop cluster etc.) -->


## Input Data 

<!-- - The input data has to be a Digital Behavioral Data (DBD) Dataset -->
<!-- - You can provide link to a public DBD dataset. GESIS DBD datasets (https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/digital-behavioral-data) -->

`oolong` accepts topic models and prediction models trained on text data.

## Sample Input and Output Data

<!-- - Show how the input data looks like through few sample instances -->
<!-- - Providing a sample output on the sample input to help cross check  -->
